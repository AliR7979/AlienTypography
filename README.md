# Art Direction

 Inspired by the haunting universe of the "Alien Convenant" franchise. AlienTypography is a digital exploration of variable typefonts with an essence of Aliens. 
 
 This site aims to transport visitors into the enigmatic universe of the Xenomorph X121, Drawing inspiration from the Alien Covenant franchise, the site combines variable typography, animations, and a dark, mysterious aesthetic to evoke feelings of curiosity, intrigue, and suspense.

 This site shows the implementation of open-source variable fonts. Variable typography plays a crucial role in enhancing a more immersive and interactive user experience by playing around with the axis and animation properties.
 As users navigate through the website, they encounter various iterations of the alien typography, each representing different facets of the Xenomorph X121's communication system. The use of variable fonts has added depth and authenticity to my project, engaging the viewers to scroll through and read along till the end.

 By the end of the website, there are sections where "Alien Language" is being implemented. **You are ment to understand their language and decipher its hidden meanings**.

## It's a cosmic odyssey into the heart of typography and beyond.
